# URL-saver
A Python exe file which can save your URLs and open them in Google.

Make sure you have Google Chrome installed. The program will try finding the chrome.exe file in order to open the URL.

The folder with all URLs can be found in your Documents folder.

Please keep in mind it only works with Google. I may add more browsers in the future.
